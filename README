About
=====

`mvre` is a command line utility to systematically rename lots of
files. It uses regular expressions to match POSIX paths and
backreferences to 'copy over' parts of the file path. For a
complete and up-to-date description of the utility's capabilities
and information on its usage, please run it with the `-h` option:

    ./mvre.py -h

Platform Compatibility
======================

`mvre` is compatible with all POSIX filesystems. This includes
all distributions of Linux and Mac OS X. `mvre` is mainly
developed for, and has been tested on, Ubuntu.

Please note that this utility will *NEVER* be compatible with
MS Windows, since Windows' path separator (the backslash)
conflicts with the regex escape character.

Dependencies
============

`mvre` requires Python 2.5 or later. (Earlier versions might also
work, but use them at your own risk.)

`mvre` also relies on the Python module `argparse`. It is
available on Debian-based platforms in the package
`python-argparse`. (Please use your favorite web search engine to
find RPM or source code distributions of it.)

Name
====

The name of this utility, `mvre` is composed of the Unix command
`mv` for moving or renaming files, and `re`, which stands for
'regular expressions'.
